Guide to Getting Shit Done

1. pete's home page is good, nearly finished, needs some final polish + functionality
2. mitch's template is good, clean, open ended, and versatile.
	recommend moving on this template for nearly everything now
3. my template is great for pages outside of the scope of this project
	originally I designed these to be a sort of page where frequent users would go to
	this is much more easily implemented with the changes going forward, which are outside
	the scope of this project
	
Gameplan:
	for next week:
	focus on Mitch's template
		concerted effort for functionality (mobile) and ease of expansion
		get some well coded classes and shit in there and stuff
			seems pretty easy to modify what's there already
		iterate upon this one design
			it may seem sparse but will make for a very homogenous looking website
				this is good for navigability - if you learn one page you learn them all
	
	afterwards:
		final touches on pages
		build actual sitemap
		begin populating
		create "going-forward" roadmap
