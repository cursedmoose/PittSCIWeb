CS Website Usability Meeting Notes 9-15-16

Who does what:
	Students (Grad/Undergrad) are responsible for editing the pages about themselves
	Angela
		Different permissions from McKenzie
		Can edit text
		Must send files to McKenzie to upload
		
Content Added:
	News Items/Events
		Already have forms to create
		Simple process of Log-in, add template
		Needs certain access which isn't uniform to those who need it
	Files
		Uploaded through Filezilla, placed in unknown location
	Pages
		In-line editor (could improve)
		Non-homogenous, some need to be edited in Dreamweaver
		
Angela:
	Easy access to:
		Permission numbers
		Course Schedules
		Enrollment/Student Reports
			Currently in 3 places, must be manually tracked/updated
		Textbooks
			To University Store
				Needs to be re-filed every semester, regardless of change
			To TAs
	Students Cannot Find Relevant Info
		Too much text
		Requirements/prereqs/coreqs
		Schedule of Courses
	Combined Branding of CS Department between Students/Faculty/etc
	Home page geared towards recruitment
		New Students
		Grad Students

McKenzie:
	Wants Better Layout
		Organization is difficult
		Currently columns and text
		Better access to
			Requirements
			Events
			Jobs/Faculty Recruiting
	Has access to creation buttons that others do not have access to
	News/Events Overhaul
		Currently hard to navigate and find relevant events
		
Ideas:
	Create separate portals based on affiliation:
		Prospective Students
		Undergrads
		Grads
		Faculty
	Tailor these individual portals to the people using them
		May have some overlap between the two
